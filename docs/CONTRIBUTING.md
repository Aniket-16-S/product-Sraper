# 🤝 Contributing to ProductScraper

#### Hey there! 👋
#### Thanks for checking out our scraper project. Whether you're here to fix a bug, add features, or just vibe with the code — you're welcome. This doc will guide you through how to contribute the right way™.

---

## What Can You Contribute?
We’re down for all of these:

- 🐞 Bug fixes

- ✨ New feature ideas (like adding more sites: Meesho, Ajio, etc.)

- 🧪 Writing and improving tests

- 🧼 Code cleanup and performance improvements

- 📚 Improving docs (README, scraper usage, etc.)

## 🛠️ How to Contribute
### 1. 🍴 Fork the Repo

Click the Fork button at the top right of this page. Clone your fork to your system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aniket-16-S/product-scraper.git
```
```bash
cd product-scraper
```

### 2. 🔃 Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your fix or feature:
Ex.
```bash
git checkout -b fix/fix-typo-in-readme
```
Branch names like feature/, fix/, or chore/ help keep things clean.

### 3. 🚧 Make Your Changes
Write clean, readable code. Bonus points for:

- Typing with type hints

- Async code style (if applicable)

- Docstrings & comments

- Following existing folder structure

- If you're adding a new scraper (like for Tata CLiQ, Croma), use the same modular format used in amazon.py and flipkart.py.

### 4. 🧪 Test Before You Push
Make sure your changes don’t break the world.
Run your script locally and check:

- No crashes

- Output is as expected

- Images & product data align

### 5. 📦 Commit the Right Way
Use clear commit messages:
Ex.
```bash
git commit -m "fix(readme): typo fix in usage section"
```
Then push it:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```
